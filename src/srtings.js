    para: 'Teamwork is the collaborative effort of a team to achieve a common goal or to complete a task in the most effective and efficient way. This concept is seen within the greater framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal. Basic requirements for effective teamwork are an adequate team size (about 6-8 members), available resources for the team to make use of (i.e. meeting space and time, guidance from a supervisor, support from the organization, etc.), and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone to have a clear purpose.Teamwork is present in any context where a group of people are working together to achieve a common goal. These contexts include an industrial organization (formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams). In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate (e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and collaboration present between team members.'

    skill: 'Leadership',
    para: 'Leader is an integral part of work and social life. In any situation, when people want to accomplish some goal, a leader is required. Leadership occurs in all formal and informal situations. In a non-formal situation, such as a group of friends, leadership behaviour occurs when one individual takes lead in most of the group activities and influences people to work towards common goals.'
}, {
    skill: 'Cooperation',
    para: 'Cooperation enables people to set aside their differences and arrive at a mutual solution for achieving a common goal.The society cannot exist without cooperation. Consensus holds society together and it is cooperation which points up and strengthens consensus.Cooperation makes possible division of labor and specialization of function. The modern technological advancement, which requires specialization of skills and functions, is increasingly replacing direct cooperation by indirect one.'

    skill: 'Tenacity',
    para: 'For many, the demands of college are the greatest challenges they have yet faced. Daily, students are exposed to a barrage of new ideas that they must quickly grasp to meet ever present deadlines. This unrelenting process is made more difficult with schedule conflicts with work, financial difficulties, and other personal problems. Many are overwhelmed by it all, yet every year people graduate while others dropout. In most cases, only one thing separates those that graduate from those that dropout. That one thing is tenacity. Tenacity is found in all people that succeed and it has benefits even in failure.'

Man is born to work and prosper in life. He like steel shines in use and rusts in rest. The work is worship. The man of actions acts in the living present. There is no tomorrow for him. He makes the best of time. Life is full of strife. It is the action, activity of law of nature. A life of idleness is a life of shame and disgrace. Idle men are intruders on society. We are endowed with brain and limbs, which are meant to be properly exercised. The failure in life is very often due to idleness.
